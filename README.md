## About Enraiged

> **Please Note:** This library is currently a work in progress and not yet ready for production use.

The Enraiged system is built atop the Laravel framework and is intended to provide various additional features and 
functionality to simplify initial project set-up and readiness.

The driving philosophy behind Enraiged is to **help, not hinder** the developer in getting a project from first install
through to production.


## Install Enraiged Support

Enraiged Support is an aggregate library containing the support systems for Enraiged projects. It is recommended to use
the [Enraiged Breeze](https://github.com/tcytra/enraiged-breeze) or

That said, you may use composer to manually install Enraiged Core into your Laravel project:
